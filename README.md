Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool
This project provides a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encrypt Messages: Shift each letter in your message by a specified number of positions.
Decrypt Messages: Reverse the shift to retrieve the original message.
User Interface: Simple command-line interface for encryption, decryption, or quitting the program.
